# AWS Cloud Engineer Daily Task.

### 1. Infrastructure Management & Monitoring
  ### Daily Cloud Resource Monitoring:

     Check AWS CloudWatch dashboards for resource health (EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, etc.).

     Monitor auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and EKS/ECS clusters.

     Troubleshoot Performance Issues:

     Resolve latency, downtime, or misconfigured services (e.g., Route 53, API Gateway).

     Manage Multi-Account/Region Deployments:

     Use AWS Organizations and Control Tower for governance.

     Ensure consistency across global regions (e.g., us-east-1, ap-southeast-1).

### 2. Automation & DevOps
     Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

     Update/maintain CloudFormation templates or Terraform configurations.

     Automate provisioning of VPCs, security groups, and serverless architectures.

     CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance:

     Fix broken pipelines in AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, or Jenkins.

     Integrate automated testing and deployment for microservices.

### Scripting:

     Write Python/Bash scripts for log analysis (CloudTrail, S3 access logs) or cleanup tasks.

### 3. Security & Compliance
     IAM & Security Hardening:

     Audit IAM roles/policies for least-privilege access.

     Rotate credentials (e.g., access keys, RDS master passwords).

     Compliance Checks:

     Run AWS Config rules or Security Hub for PCI-DSS/GDPR compliance.

     Review GuardDuty findings for suspicious activity.

     Disaster Recovery (DR):

     Test backup/restore processes for RDS snapshots, EBS volumes, or S3 cross-region replication.

### 4. Cost Optimization
    Cost Analysis:

    Use AWS Cost Explorer to identify underutilized resources (e.g., idle EC2 instances, orphaned EBS volumes).

    Recommend Reserved Instance purchases or Savings Plans.

### Budget Alerts:

    Set up Cost Anomaly Detection alerts for unexpected spikes.

    Cleanup unused resources (e.g., old AMIs, unattached Elastic IPs).

### 5. Collaboration & Support
    Cross-Team Coordination:

    Work with DevOps teams to optimize containerized workloads (EKS, ECS).

    Assist developers with debugging serverless apps (Lambda, DynamoDB).

    Incident Response:

    Participate in post-mortems for outages (e.g., root cause analysis via CloudTrail).

    Documentation:

    Update runbooks, architecture diagrams (using Lucidchart/Draw.io), and Confluence pages.

### 6. Service Adoption & Innovation
    Evaluate New AWS Services:

    Test beta services (e.g., Amazon Q for AI/ML, Aurora Serverless v2).

    Migrate legacy systems to modern architectures (e.g., EC2 → Lambda).

    Proof of Concept (PoC) Development:

    Build prototypes for edge computing (AWS Wavelength) or IoT solutions (AWS IoT Core).

### 7. Training & Certification
  ## Upskill:

     Study for AWS certifications (e.g., Solutions Architect Professional, Security Specialty).

     Attend AWS re:Invent sessions or internal knowledge-sharing workshops.

### Example Day-in-the-Life

    Morning: Check CloudWatch alarms, resolve a stuck CodePipeline deployment.

    Midday: Fix IAM policy misconfiguration reported by Security Hub.

    Afternoon: Optimize DynamoDB throughput costs using auto-scaling.

    Evening: Document a new VPC peering setup for a cross-account project.

### Key Tools & AWS Services Used Daily
    IaC: CloudFormation, Terraform, AWS CDK

    Monitoring: CloudWatch, X-Ray, Datadog

    Security: IAM, KMS, AWS WAF, Inspector

    Automation: Lambda, Step Functions, Systems Manager

    Cost: Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor

### Soft Skills Required
    Problem-Solving: Debugging distributed systems.

    Communication: Translating technical details for non-technical stakeholders.

    Adaptability: Keeping up with AWS’s rapid service releases.

### In an MNC, you’ll often work with global teams, adhere to strict compliance frameworks, and manage large-scale, multi-cloud/hybrid environments. The role is dynamic, blending technical depth with strategic thinking!
